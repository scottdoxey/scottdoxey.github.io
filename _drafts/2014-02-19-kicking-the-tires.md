This is a sample post created for the sole purpose of sending an unfinished draft to someone for editing. Most likely there will be many edits fixing my grammar and spelling. This is partially due to the fact that I don't write as often as I should.

Most of the time when I write an article it sits on my computer for months finished and un-edited. Because of this any blog that I build ends up having one or two decent posts. After that my site becomes increasingly neglected until I rebuild the entire thing from the ground up and rewrite all the content. This of course I would like to change.
