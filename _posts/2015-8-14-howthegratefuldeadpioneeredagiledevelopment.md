The Grateful Dead recently made big headlines with their series of “Fare Thee Well” shows marking both the band’s fiftieth anniversary and their farewell to performing as a unit. Since Jerry Garcia’s death in 1995 the band has gone from counter culture heroes to mainstream accolades for their many contributions to the music community, technology and American culture. More recently, an influx of college courses, conferences, and books teach the lessons that business and society can take from the Dead’s rich history.

In the spirit of full transparency, I’ve been a Deadhead for many years, long before they were held up as role models for creating value “on their own terms”. And while I have been well versed in their history as part of my own love affair with the band, it’s only recently I realized the connection to the world of software development I inhabit in my work life.

One major element of their story also highlights their roles as early pioneers of Agile (yes that Agile). The now ubiquitous approach to software development is not as old as the Dead, but their approach to creating the optimal live experience shows the Dead to be among other things, early pioneers of the agile philosophy.

On to the story. The Dead have long been known as a unique and powerful live act, and they realized this was their strength early on in their career. This realization drove them to do everything they could to optimize the live experience for their fans, and themselves. One of the major aspects of this experience is, of course, sound but in the early years of the band’s existence live sound, or sound reinforcement, was dreadful – particularly in contrast to today’s live experience. Even in the earliest days the band had been surrounding itself with brilliant, albeit eccentric, experts in audio and electronics and together they envisioned a system that would solve these issues. A system that would provide the ability for the band to play with power (or volume) while retaining the clarity (or hi-fidelity) necessary for their particular approach to music to work in a live setting.

With this vision established the band empowered their crew of experts to achieve this goal with few constraints. As Brian Anderson’s details in his excellent article in Motherboard the crew began a multi-year process to build their ultimate system. I won’t go into all of the details here, but in approximately five years from the late 60’s to early 70’s the crew iterated through many variations of sound systems, before achieving their ultimate 1.0 release – the Wall of Sound.

The technical details behind the wall are staggering and while the audio geek in me would love to dive in now, I’ll let interested readers get their fill here or here. Suffice to say the output of their continual iterations was a system unlike any other seen in the world of rock and roll to that point (1974). Essentially the approach was to create a PA made up of multiple, smaller PAs that were aligned in massive backline behind and around the band. The system gave the musicians direct control over the volume and directionality of the system and was amazingly loud with little to no distortion – unheard of in the early 1970s. The Wall broke so many patterns and assumptions about live sound the reverberations (sorry) can still be felt today.

Nice story but where do we make the leap to pioneers of agile? Three main reasons:

Establishing a common goal. The band and crew came together on a unified vision or goal – volume with fidelity – at the outset of the effort. A common set of goals is a requisite for a successful project in any framework and agile is no exception. In fact the ability to adapt to change, the core strength of the agile approach, also puts a premium on an understanding of a common goal set of vision to provide ultimate direction.

The freedom to fail, and try again. This is the big one. The band empowered their crew to experiment, learn from their work and improve the output. The system was so advanced the band had to custom design and build a number of the components to achieve their goals. As a result, the crew would routinely audition new versions of their systems during live gigs, allowing them to understand what worked, what didn’t and what could be improved. Some of the stories around the development of the system are legendary in Deadhead circles, for instance when the band tried out a new version of the system at a show at Stanford U in February 1973 only to blow up the entire set of newly designed tweeters in the first few minutes! The crew was able to modify the system “on the fly” and the show went on to become one of their landmark performances but more importantly, the crew came away with an important, and expensive, data point on how to build their speakers to accommodate the new approach. Even after the official Wall was rolled out in 1974, the crew continually tweaked the system while the band was touring.

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.  This is one of the main principles behind the Agile philosophy and this effort is a great example of that ethos in action. The Dead were never much for organization, in fact many key members of the organization entered the scene by seeing a need and filling it, and the band was well known for their support in these scenarios. There were several key players involved with the early development of their audio vision – Bear Owsley, Dan Healy, Rick Turner, etc. – and the band provided the ongoing environment, support and trust to achieve their ultimate vision.

So what happened? Why don’t all PAs look like this now?

In true Dead fashion, the ultimate vision was beyond the reality of their situation. To be more blunt, the system, while incredible and impressive, was extremely expensive to cart around the country and maintain. It was so large they needed two, leapfrogging rigging crews to ensure that the scaffolding was in place when they arrived at the venue. And the power requirements flummoxed many an arena operator in those days. By the end of 1974, the band had achieved a new peak of popularity and were playing bigger gigs all the time, but the cost of the system was bankrupting the organization. Ultimately the band took a hiatus at the end of the year and the system was mothballed. And sound reinforcement technology continued to progress, allowing bands to provide good sound (although not quite as good!) for less.

From a business perspective that may be the best lesson. While it’s critical to establish a vision and common set of goals and to empower your team to fail until they succeed, boundaries have to be clear as well. The Dead and crew achieved their goal but did not really pay attention to the big picture and ended up with a tremendous, but eventually problematic, product.

Of course, the band would recover and the crew, to their credit, also learned to find the middle ground between technology, cost and quality. And isn’t that the state we are all trying to achieve?
